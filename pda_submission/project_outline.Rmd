# General

### Data Requirements

The data you use in the project has to meet the following criteria:

- At least 5,000 rows
- At least 3 sources of data
- Must contain text data, numeric data and dates

## Context

#### Business intelligence and data-driven decision making

What insights can the business/organisation gain from your analysis and how will your analysis help the business/organisation make better decisions? 

This analysis aims to identify those economies which are heading in the right direction - growing, productive economies which are environmentally and socially sustainable. 

#### Domain knowledge and the business context

Briefly describe the business/organisation and where your analysis fits within its aims/activity. 

The World Economic Forum is an international organization with no commercial interest, the Forum provides a platform for leaders from all stakeholder groups from around the world – business, government and civil society – to come together.

## Data

#### Internal and external data sources

Briefly describe your data sources and which were internal (provided by the organisation) and external (not sourced from the organisation's data)

#### Types of data

What kind of data did you work with? E.g. categorical and numerical data and their sub-types.

The data collected/generated on each country was mostly numeric and was organised into world rankings. 


#### Data formats

What format did your data come in? E.g. all downloaded flat files (CSV) or any data from APIs, scraping etc.

All of the data used in this analysis was downloaded from the sources in either csv or excel format. 

#### Data quality and bias

Briefly describe the quality of the data and whether you have any reasons to suggest the data is biased e.g. only data from a specific demographic even though a broader demographic would be of interest to the organisation.


## Ethics

#### Ethical issues in data sourcing and extraction

Do you have any ethical concerns regarding the sourcing and extraction of your data? 
Ultimately the metrics included in this analysis are hard to quantify. The methods to work out global competitiveness and the global sustainability competitiveness are very complex. The standardised methodology across all countries helps to reduce bias however the methods may favour certain kinds of economies. The weighting placed on the various factors to calculate the indexes will also play a part in this. 

#### Ethical implications of business requirements

Are there any ethical implications of the business requirements?

## Analysis

#### Stages in the data analysis process

What were the main stages in your data analysis process?
1) Planning - gathering data sources
2) Cleaning and data preparation - combining several datasets and extracting the necessary information
3) Data exploration through visualisation
4) Clustering analysis
5) Interpretation of results 
6) Presentation

#### Tools for data analysis

What were the main tools you used for your analysis?

I used RStudio to conduct the analysis and PowerPoint to present the main findings of the analysis. I used excalidraw in the planning stages. The R packages I used were: 

General data manipulation & cleaning:
* tidyverse
* janitor
* here
* snakecase
* tidytext
* countrycode

Data visualisation - predominantly ggplot2, as well as:
* RColorBrewer
* extrafont
* ggbump
* ggridges

Clustering analysis:
* broom
* corrr
* factoextra

Spatial plotting: 
* rworldmap
* rnaturalearth
* sf



#### Descriptive, diagnostic, predictive and prescriptive analysis

Please report under which of the below categories your analysis falls **and why** (can be more than one) 

::: {.emphasis}
**Descriptive Analytics** tells you what happened in the past.

**Diagnostic Analytics** helps you understand why something happened in the past.

**Predictive Analytics** predicts what is most likely to happen in the future.

**Prescriptive Analytics** recommends actions you can take to affect those outcomes.
